### Welcome! I'm Rachel (she/they) 🦂🦁🦂 

I graduated from Project Shift - Software Engineering Fellowship in July 2020. I currenlty volunteer with [Out in Tech](https://outintech.com/digital-corps/) and am a developer with [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/). 

- 🚧 I’m in the collab's lab's cohort 20 for their advanced project! We are creating a mobile react web app that shows you nearby Wikipedia entries! View the [Demo](https://tcl-20-whats-near-me.netlify.app/) and the [Source Code](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-20-whats-near-me)
- 🔭 I finished the collab lab's cohort 13 & created a PWA with react, firebase, chakra-ui & netlify this fall!

- 💻 I love the collab lab & help organize and run their [tech talks](https://the-collab-lab.codes/tech-talks)

- 🌱 I’m learning more about responsible and ethical AI. I love learning about the intersection of tech & law.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I studied international and area studies in undergrad and studied abroad in South Africa and Tanzania. I also attended law school at Howard University School of Law.
